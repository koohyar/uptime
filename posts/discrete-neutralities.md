Sometimes the flat scopes are worth your while, despite common belief. If a
scope is runtime invariant, or if it preserves the state, then it is nice to
store something next to it. You would need to move less later, which is good
for the others in our own scope as well. But being flat means you can only store
simple things. Nowadays you want everything about your state to be always with
you. So instead of flat scopes, you go for sophisticated equivalence classes
which are supposed to give you full freedom of representation. Usually this
means going back to the main scope to hang out with everybody else when it
comes to the choice, so the *representation* is actually in most cases quite simple.

Moreover, scopes are not there to store assumptions. They are less
present, especially now that the partitions are doing their job. It turns out you don't
need to be there when global scope looks for your stuff in partitions.

But flat scopes are more than that. Caring for your invariances becomes easier.
They keep your projections in tact, and you keep the projections away from
bias...  well, from your own resolution to be precise. What you get is good
rests while partitions find their way around the environment and meanwhile
enjoy a proper resolution. No need for checking for valid deconstructions
during what might as well be a nested orbit of magnitudes in sqaures! 

What makes it somewhat difficult to get used to is that you do not really know
when the partitions appear. All of this new invariance jargon has let us simply
ignore our projections, which is nice for most of the time. But every now and
then there are a good couple of cycles where there is enough variance for everyone to
expand a bit.  This can be a good thing. Normally, you are in fact *not* within
a nested orbit of squares. The nested or the orbit more than easily suffice to
interpret the squares however you like. Storing the variance for a few
cycles is surely worth the cool effects it has on the
scope's parsing. The unbiased expansions get quite comfortable edges that
usually don't resolve that quickly. So you get to look around for a longer time
and see what is happening outside the scope, where it usually looks less
complex and you get simpler paths ahead.

Flat scopes were not as much needed with older normal partitions. It was always good
to keep note of uniforms (well, norms, to be formal) instead. They give you linear
potential and you would be free to move around as you like, explore and see if
any textures might interest you. This is still the case, as norms don't have
much to do with the partitioning, except for the case of the nice variance over
the scope boundaries, in which case you do not worry
about boudanries to begin with. Being bound should be enough and you do
not need to know your place. You get to watch small unbiased perturbations
of white noise while you pack for simpler means.
